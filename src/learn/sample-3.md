This is the start of the article with ex&#173;ample text in Eng&#173;lish. It also has [hyper&#173;links](/) and other text styles such as *emph&#173;asis*, **strong**, etcetera, inter&#173;spersed with text that may be needed such as <i>italic</i><!--  and&#160;<b>bold</b> -->. Thus the [second bit](/) starts here with a short ditty in block&#173;quotes on the beauty of ugly&#160;things:

<blockquote>
  <p>Blockquote/pull quote: Oh, things that are called gross and foul and unsightly come forth in joy for you are as you are and there is no ugliness, just ignorance, taste and&#160;context.</p>
  <p>Blockquote/pull quote: Oh, things that are called gross and foul and unsightly come forth in joy for you are as you are and there is no ugliness, just ignorance, taste and&#160;context.</p>
  <cite><a href="/">Author Name</a>, <a href="/"><i>publication</i></a>, 1852, <abbr title="page">p</abbr>19.</cite>
</blockquote>

176 words&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;suffi&#173;cient length to get a better feel for measure, colour, and typo&#173;graphic nuance in the text. A series of words that only alludes to feel&#173;ings with&#173;out ever sufficient&#173;ly describ&#173;ing them. Rather, theyâ€™re like a finger point&#173;ing the way â˜ž, but the emotions live in the counters, in the gaps between words and colour and form and layout. The feel&#173;ings take shape in the brain without lang&#173;uage. An <a href="/">amygdalic</a> flux of recept&#173;ion and react&#173;ion. Senses soak everything in without words. Physio&#173;logical counter&#173;points return&#173;ing signals to be processed into lang&#173;uage that barely even explains what that shape, sound, or text instan&#173;tiated inside us. Instead, we feel the sensory inputs and reach for words after the fact, sloughing into the actual impressions to form literal ones. Thus we communicate, awkwardly, sometimes beautifully, but rarely clearly. The words point the way to a shared experience, or to one that could be shared if they inspire action. So it could be said that describing our senses is an invitation to others to share them, not an explaination of&#160;them.

- A regular unordered list with standard 1/2 line height gutters
- The second list item
- And the third

Immersion is completed by the mere persistence of reading this far in the age of &#8216;tl;dr&#8217; (a grossosity to coin an equally dislikeable string). Nevertheless bevity is appreciated but leaves little room for those moods that can only be created with cadence and phrasing that sometimes&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;not always&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;makes art from&#160;prose.

<ul class="short-list">
  <li>Class="short-list": And unordered short-list with no li gutters</li>
  <li>And this is another</li>
  <li>With a final one for completeness</li>
</ul>

Another â€™graph to end on a block before the h2 test. This can be short,&#160;right?

Rather, theyâ€™re like a finger point&#173;ing â˜ž the way, but the emotions lives in the counters, in the gaps between words and colour and form and layout. The feel&#173;ings take shap in the brain without lang&#173;uage.

1. A regular ordered list with standard 1/2 line height gutters
2. The second list item
3. And the third

An [amygdalic](/) flux of recept&#173;ion and react&#173;ion. Senses soaking, physio&#173;logical counter&#173;points return&#173;ing signals to be processed into lang&#173;uage that barely even explains what that shape, sound, or text instan&#173;tiated inside us. Instead, we feel the sensory inputs and reach for words after the fact, sloughing into the actual impressions to form literal ones.

### Header three

<div class="marginalia">
  <p>Class="marginalia" note that can be a â€™graph over multple lines with <a href="/">hyperlinks</a> and <em>emphasised</em> text.</p>
</div>	

Thus we communicate, awk&#173;wardly, some&#173;times beauti&#173;fully, but rarely clearly. The words point the way to a shared experience, or to one that could be shared if they inspire action. So it could be said that describing our senses is an invitation to others to share them, not an explanation of&#160;them.

#### Header four

<ol class="short-list">
  <li>Class="short-list": And ordered short-list with no li gutters</li>
  <li>And this is another</li>
  <li>With a final one for completeness</li>
</ol>

This is the end, beautiful friend. ðŸ‘‹
